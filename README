With the introduction of the autoload directory, plugins were often 
split into several separate files. The downside is that it isn't always 
that obvious which files are actually loaded on startup.

This macro creates a CSV file including a list of loaded files during 
startup and some indicators (number of lines/bytes, timing). You can 
open this (semicolon-separated) CSV in any spreadsheet application, sort 
the data etc.

In order to activate the macro, check the value of g:startup_profile_csv 
in the source code and temporarily insert the following line(s) at the 
beginning of your |vimrc| file: >

    " Setting g:startup_profile_csv is optional.
    let g:startup_profile_csv = "..."
    runtime macros/startup_profile.vim

The list can serve as a starting point for optimizing your startup time, 
e.g. by delaying certain calls to functions in autoload files or by 
making use of the AsNeeded (vimscript #915) or the tplugin (vimscript #2917) 
plugins.

Depending on your system configuration and the speed of your hard drive, 
seeking for files or, e.g., creating menu entries may prove to be costly 
with respect to startup time.
